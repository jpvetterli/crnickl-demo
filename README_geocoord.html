Thank you for your interest in CrNiCKL.
<p>
CrNiCKL (pronounced <q>chronicle</q>) is a database for time series running on top of 
SQL and (soon) NoSQL systems.
<p>
This note explains how to run the <b>geocoord</b> demo in crnickl-demo-1.1.1.jar
(or a later version of the archive). 
The archive is large because all required third party libraries are included.
The command line syntax assumes Linux, but things are kept simple
and no special knowledge is required, except some familiarity with Java. 
Of course, to run the demos, you need to have basic Java tools installed.
<p>
A required prelimary step is to extract all libraries from the archive 
(the ls command lists the directory before and after):
<xmp>$ ls
crnickl-demo-1.1.1.jar
$ jar xf crnickl-demo-1.1.1.jar lib
$ ls -1 lib
batik-awt-util.jar
batik-svggen.jar
batik-util.jar
crnickl-jdbc-1.1.0.jar
hsqldb.jar
jcommon-1.0.16.jar
jfreechart-1.0.13.jar
sqltool.jar
t2-1.1.4.jar
</xmp>
The t2-1.1.4.jar and crnickl-jdbc-1.1.0.jar archives are our time series libraries.
The hsqldb archive contains the HyperSQL JDBC driver and sqltool is used to set up the 
database from scratch. HyperSQL is useful in a demo like this because it can run in memory, and
there is nothing to set up before running the demo. The other libraries are not used by
this demo.
<p>
The <b>geocoord</b> demo is a toy version of a database supporting geographical 
postioning data.
<p>
To run the demo:
<xmp>$ java -cp crnickl-demo-1.1.1.jar ch.agent.crnickl.demo.geocoord.GeoCoordDemo Resources/geocoord.parm

The exact figures vary with each run because the data is random.
