The <b>geocoord</b> demo shows how to set up
a database to use custom value types for series.
<p>
The custom type is in question is GeoCoord. This interface is
a quick shot solution for geographical position data with
a toy implementation in CartesianGeoCoord.
It is supported as a CrNiCKL value type with the help of a
value scanner class, GeoCoordValueScanner. GeoCoordDatabase,
a subclass of the standard JDBC implementation, must be told
of this custom value scanner. A ValueAccessMethods<GeoCoord> class 
must be also provided.
<p>
Just for fun, the demo also uses a non-standard type of time, FooTime.
